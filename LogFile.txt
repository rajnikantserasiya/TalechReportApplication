Hi,

Below are my thoughts/sequences on how i will implement sample form.

1) Provide one action button and on click on it, it will open integrator form (popup)
2) In integrator form i will provide one integrator MS SQL Server
3) Clicking on MS SQL Server integrator, it will open one popup which displays list of actions that we can perform on it 
  (Like delete row, execute store procedure and so on)
4) After clicking on one of action, it will display form loaded from json

In step 4, 
Do i need to write code to fetch form details from SQL Server table OR you will provide any json form file and then i will load form from that json ?

Please let me know i am on right track or not.
